# Release notes

This is version 1.0 of *Explore Flask*. This has just under twice as many chapters as the last pre-release (0.02). I've tried to polish everything up as best as I can, but it's hard to spot all of the errors. Feel free to get in touch with suggestions, feedback, questions or just to chat.

## Thank you

First of all, I'd like to say thank you to my volunteer editor, Will Kahn-Greene. He's been great about going over my very rough drafts and helping me decide on the scope and direction of the content.

Another big thanks to everyone who took the time to talk with me about how they are using Flask. This includes Armin Ronacher (Flask creator), Mark Harviston (Elsevier), Glenn Yonemitsu (Markup Hive), Andy Parsons (Happify), Oleg Lavrovsky (Apps with love), Joel Anderson (Cloudmancer) and Mahmoud Abdelkader (Balanced).

The cover and all the illustrations in this book were done by Dominic Flask [http://www.dangerdom.com/].

*Explore Flask* wouldn't be happening if it weren't for the hundreds of people who backed the project on Kickstarter. As promised in the Kickstarter project, here are the names of all of the generous men and women who pledged $50 or more:
