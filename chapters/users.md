# Patterns for handling users

![Patterns for handling users](images/users.png)

One of the most common things that modern web applications need to do is handle users. An application with basic account features needs to handle a lot of things like registration, email confirmation, securely storing passwords, secure password reset, authentication and more. Since a lot of security issues present themselves when it comes to handling users, it's generally best to stick to standard patterns in this area.

\begin{aside}
\label{aside:}
\heading{A note on assumptions}

In this chapter I'm going to assume that you're using SQLAlchemy models and WTForms to handle your form input. If you aren't using those, you'll need to adapt these patterns to your preferred methods.

\end{aside}

## Email confirmation

When a new user gives us their email, we generally want to confirm that they gave us the right one. Once we've made that confirmation, we can confidently send password reset links and other sensitive information to our users without wondering who is on the receiving end.

One of the most common patterns for confirming emails is to send a password reset link with a unique URL that, when visited, confirms that user's email address. For example, john@gmail.com signs up at our application. We register him in the database with an `email_confirmed` column set to `False` and fire off an email to john@gmail.com with a unique URL. This URL usually contains a unique token, e.g. _http://myapp.com/accounts/confirm\-/Q2hhZCBDYXRsZXR0IHJvY2tzIG15IHNvY2tz_. When John gets that email, he clicks the link. Our app sees the token, knows which email to confirm and sets John's `email_confirmed` column to `Tr\-ue`.

How do we know which email to confirm with a given token? One way would be to store the token in the database when it is created and check that table when we receive the confirmation request. That's a lot of overhead and, lucky for us, it's unnecessary.

We're going to encode the email address in the token. The token will also contain a timestamp to let us set a time limit on how long it's valid. To do this, we'll use the `itsdangerous` package. This package gives us tools to send sensitive data into untrusted environments (like sending an email confirmation token to an unconfirmed email). In this case, we're going to use an instance of the `URLSafeTimedSerializer` class.

\begin{codelisting}
\label{code:}
\codecaption{Creating our instance of \texttt{URLSafeTimedSerializer}}
```python
# ourapp/util/security.py

from itsdangerous import URLSafeTimedSerializer

from .. import app

ts = URLSafeTimedSerializer(app.config["SECRET_KEY"])
```
\end{codelisting}

We can use that serializer to generate a confirmation token when a user gives us their email address. We'll implement a simple account creation process using this method.

\begin{codelisting}
\label{code:confirm1}
\codecaption{Sending a verification email during registration}
```python
# ourapp/views.py

from flask import redirect, render_template, url_for

from . import app, db
from .forms import EmailPasswordForm
from .util import ts, send_email

@app.route('/accounts/create', methods=["GET", "POST"])
def create_account():
    form = EmailPasswordForm()
    if form.validate_on_submit():
        user = User(
            email = form.email.data,
            password = form.password.data
        )
        db.session.add(user)
        db.session.commit()

        # Now we'll send the email confirmation link
        subject = "Confirm your email"

        token = ts.dumps(self.email, salt='email-confirm-key')

        confirm_url = url_for(
            'confirm_email',
            token=token,
            _external=True)

        html = render_template(
            'email/activate.html',
            confirm_url=confirm_url)

        # We'll assume that send_email has been defined in myapp/util.py
        send_email(user.email, subject, html)

        return redirect(url_for("index"))

    return render_template("accounts/create.html", form=form)
```
\end{codelisting}

The view in Listing~\ref{code:confirm1} handles the creation of the user and sends off an email to the given email address. You may notice that we're using a template to generate the HTML for the email.

\begin{codelisting}
\label{code:}
\codecaption{An example template for the email}
```jinja
{# ourapp/templates/email/activate.html #}

Your account was successfully created. Please click the link below<br>
to confirm your email address and activate your account:

<p>
<a href="{{ confirm_url }}">{{ confirm_url }}</a>
</p>

<p>
--<br>
Questions? Comments? Email hello@myapp.com.
</p>
```
\end{codelisting}

Okay, so now we just need to implement a view that handles the confirmation link in that email.

\begin{codelisting}
\label{code:}
\codecaption{A view that handles a confirmation token}
```python
# ourapp/views.py

@app.route('/confirm/<token>')
def confirm_email(token):
    try:
        email = ts.loads(token, salt="email-confirm-key", max_age=86400)
    except:
        abort(404)

    user = User.query.filter_by(email=email).first_or_404()

    user.email_confirmed = True

    db.session.add(user)
    db.session.commit()

    return redirect(url_for('signin'))
```
\end{codelisting}

This view is a simple form view. We just add the `try ... except` bit at the beginning to check that the token is valid. The token contains a timestamp, so we can tell `ts.loads()` to raise an exception if it is older than `max_age`. In this case, we're setting `max_age` to 86400 seconds, i.e. 24 hours.

\begin{aside}
\label{aside:}
\heading{A note on updating emails}

You can use very similar methods to implement an email update feature. Just send a confirmation link to the new email address with a token that contains both the old and the new addresses. If the token is valid, update the old address with the new one.

\end{aside}

## Storing passwords
\label{sec:passwords}

Rule number one of handling users is to hash passwords with the Bcrypt (or scrypt, but we'll use Bcrypt here) algorithm before storing them. We never store passwords in plain text. It's a massive security issue and it's unfair to our users. All of the hard work has already been done and abstracted away for us, so there's no excuse for not following the best practices here.

\begin{aside}
\label{aside:}
\heading{Related Links}

- OWASP is one of the industry's most trusted source for information regarding web application security. Take a look at some of their recommendations for secure coding here: [https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Secure_Cod\-ing_Cheat_Sheet#Password_Storage](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Secure_Coding_Cheat_Sheet#Password_Storage)

\end{aside}

We'll go ahead and use the Flask-Bcrypt extension to implement the bcrypt package in our application. This extension is basically just a wrapper around the `py-bcrypt` package, but it does handle a few things that would be annoying to do ourselves (like checking string encodings before comparing hashes).

\begin{codelisting}
\label{code:}
\codecaption{Initializing our instance of \texttt{Bcrypt}}
```python
# ourapp/__init__.py

from flask.ext.bcrypt import Bcrypt

bcrypt = Bcrypt(app)
```
\end{codelisting}

One of the reasons that the Bcrypt algorithm is so highly recommended is that it is "future adaptable." This means that over time, as computing power becomes cheaper, we can make it more and more difficult to brute force the hash by guessing millions of possible passwords. The more "rounds" we use to hash the password, the longer it will take to make one guess. If we hash our passwords 20 times with the algorithm before storing them the attacker has to hash each of their guesses 20 times.

Keep in mind that if we're hashing our passwords 20 times then our application is going to take a long time to return a response that depends on that process completing. This means that when choosing the number of rounds to use, we have to balance security and usability. The number of rounds we can complete in a given amount of time will depend on the computational resources available to our application. It's a good idea to test out some different numbers and shoot for between 0.25 and 0.5 seconds to hash a password. We should try to use at least 12 rounds though.

To test the time it takes to hash a password, we can time a quick Python script that, well, hashes a password.

\begin{codelisting}
\label{code:}
\codecaption{Benchmarking our system}
```python
# benchmark.py

from flask.ext.bcrypt import generate_password_hash

# Chance the number of rounds (second argument) until it takes between
# 0.25 and 0.5 seconds to run.
generate_password_hash('password1', 12) 
```
\end{codelisting}

Now we can keep timing our changes to the number of rounds with the UNIX `time` utility.

\begin{codelisting}
\label{code:}
\codecaption{Timing our benchmark script}
```console
$ time python test.py 

real    0m0.496s
user    0m0.464s
sys     0m0.024s
```
\end{codelisting}

I did a quick benchmark on a small server that I have handy and 12 rounds seemed to take the right amount of time, so I'll configure our example to use that.

\begin{codelisting}
\label{code:}
\codecaption{Configuring our application to use 12 rounds of hashing}
```python
# config.py

BCRYPT_LOG_ROUNDS = 12
```
\end{codelisting}

Now that Flask-Bcrypt is configured, it's time to start hashing passwords. We could do this manually in the view that receives the request from the sign-up form, but we'd have to do it again in the password reset and password change views. Instead, what we'll do is abstract away the hashing so that our app does it without us even thinking about it. We'll use a **setter** so that when we set `user.password = 'password1'`, it's automatically hashed with Bcrypt before being stored.

\begin{codelisting}
\label{code:}
\codecaption{Creating a setter}
```python
# ourapp/models.py

from sqlalchemy.ext.hybrid import hybrid_property

from . import bcrypt, db

class User(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True, autoincrement=True)
    username = db.Column(db.String(64), unique=True)
    _password = db.Column(db.String(128))

    @hybrid_property
    def password(self):
        return self._password

    @password.setter
    def _set_password(self, plaintext):
        self._password = bcrypt.generate_password_hash(plaintext)
```
\end{codelisting}

We're using SQLAlchemy's hybrid extension to define a property with several different functions called from the same interface. Our setter is called when we assign a value to the `user.password` property. In it, we hash the plaintext password and store it in the `_password` column of the user table. Since we're using a hybrid property we can then access the hashed password via the same `user.password` property.

Now we can implement a sign-up view for an app using this model.

\begin{codelisting}
\label{code:}
\codecaption{A sign-up view using our setter}
```python
# ourapp/views.py

from . import app, db
from .forms import EmailPasswordForm
from .models import User

@app.route('/signup', methods=["GET", "POST"])
def signup():
    form = EmailPasswordForm()
    if form.validate_on_submit():
        user = User(username=form.username.data, password=form.password.data)
        db.session.add(user)
        db.session.commit()
        return redirect(url_for('index'))

    return render_template('signup.html', form=form)
```
\end{codelisting}

## Authentication

Now that we've got a user in the database, we can implement authentication. We'll want to let a user submit a form with their username and password (though this might be email and password for some apps), then make sure that they gave us the correct password. If it all checks out, we'll mark them as authenticated by setting a cookie in their browser. The next time they make a request we'll know that they have already logged in by looking for that cookie.

Let's start by defining a `UsernamePassword` form with WTForms.

\begin{codelisting}
\label{code:}
\codecaption{Our \texttt{UsernamePassword} form}
```python
# ourapp/forms.py

from flask.ext.wtforms import Form
from wtforms import TextField, PasswordField, Required

class UsernamePasswordForm(Form):
    username = TextField('Username', validators=[Required()])
    password = PasswordField('Password', validators=[Required()])
```
\end{codelisting}

Next we'll add a method to our user model that compares a string with the hashed password stored for that user.

\begin{codelisting}
\label{code:}
\codecaption{Adding a method to check a password}
```python
# ourapp/models.py

from . import db

class User(db.Model):

    # [...] columns and properties

    def is_correct_password(self, plaintext)
        if bcrypt.check_password_hash(self._password, plaintext):
            return True

        return False
```
\end{codelisting}

### Flask-Login

Our next goal is to define a sign-in view that serves and accepts our form. If the user enters the correct credentials, we will authenticate them using the Flask-Login extension. This extension simplifies the process of handling user sessions and authentication.

We need to do a little bit of configuration to get Flask-Login ready to roll.

In _\_\_init\_\_.py_ we'll define the Flask-Login `login_manager`.

\begin{codelisting}
\label{code:flask_login1}
\codecaption{Configuring Flask-Login}
```python
# ourapp/__init__.py

from flask.ext.login import LoginManager

# Create and configure app
# [...]

from .models import User

login_manager = LoginManager()
login_manager.init_app(app)
login_manager.login_view =  "signin"

@login_manager.user_loader
def load_user(userid):
    return User.query.filter(User.id == userid).first()
```
\end{codelisting}

In Listing~\ref{code:flask_login1} we created an instance of the `LoginManager`, initialized it with our `app` object, defined the login view and told it how to get a user object with a user's `id`. This is the baseline configuration we should have for Flask-Login.

\begin{aside}

- See more ways to customize Flask-Login here: [https://flask-login.readthedocs.org/en/latest/#customizing-the-login-process](https://flask-login.readthedocs.org/en/latest/#customizing-the-login-process)

\end{aside}

Now we can define the `signin` view that will handle authentication.

\begin{codelisting}
\label{code:}
\codecaption{Handling authentication}
```python
# ourapp/views.py

from flask import redirect, url_for

from flask.ext.login import login_user

from . import app
from .forms import UsernamePasswordForm()

@app.route('signin', methods=["GET", "POST"])
def signin():
    form = UsernamePasswordForm()

    if form.validate_on_submit():
        user = User.query.filter_by(username=form.username.data).first_or_404()
        if user.is_correct_password(form.password.data):
            login_user(user)

            return redirect(url_for('index'))
        else:
            return redirect(url_for('signin'))
    return render_template('signin.html', form=form)
```
\end{codelisting}

We simply import the `login_user` function from Flask-Login, check a user's login credentials and call `login_user(user)`. You can log the current user out with `logout_user()`.

\begin{codelisting}
\label{code:}
\codecaption{}
```python
# ourapp/views.py

from flask import redirect, url_for
from flask.ext.login import logout_user

from . import app

@app.route('/signout')
def signout():
    logout_user()

    return redirect(url_for('index'))
```
\end{codelisting}

## Forgot your password

We'll generally want to implement a "Forgot your password" feature that lets a user recover their account by email. This area has a plethora of potential vulnerabilities because the whole point is to let an unauthenticated user take over an account. We'll implement our password reset using some of the same techniques as our email confirmation.

We'll need a form to request a reset for a given account's email and a form to choose a new password once we've confirmed that the unauthenticated user has access to that email address. The code in this section assumes that our user model has an email and a password, where the password is a hybrid property as we previously created.

\begin{aside}
\label{aside:}
\heading{WARNING}

Don't send password reset links to an unconfirmed email address! You want to be sure that you are sending this link to the right person.

\end{aside}

We're going to need two forms. One is to request that a reset link be sent to a certain email and the other is to change the password once the email has been verified.

\begin{codelisting}
\label{code:reset1}
\codecaption{Defining our forms}
```python
# ourapp/forms.py

from flask.ext.wtforms import Form

from wtforms import TextField, PasswordField, Required, Email

class EmailForm(Form):
    email = TextField('Email', validators=[Required(), Email()])

class PasswordForm(Form):
    password = PasswordField('Email', validators=[Required()])
```
\end{codelisting}

Listing~\ref{code:reset1} assumes that our password reset form just needs one field for the password. Many apps require the user to enter their new password twice to confirm that they haven't made a typo. To do this, we'd simply add another `PasswordField` and add the `EqualTo` WTForms validator to the main password field.

\begin{aside}
\label{aside:}
\heading{Related Links}

There a lot of interesting discussions in the User Experience (UX) community about the best way to handle this in sign-up forms. I personally like the thoughts of one Stack Exchange user (Roger Attrill) who said:

"We should not ask for password twice - we should ask for it once and make sure that the 'forgot password' system works seamlessly and flawlessly."

- Read more about this topic in this thread on the User Experience Stack Exchange: [http://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/20953/why-should-we-ask-the-password-twice-during-registration/21141](http://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/20953/why-should-we-ask-the-password-twice-during-registration/21141)

- There are also some cool ideas for simplifying sign-up and sign-in forms in this Smashing Magazine article: [http://uxdesign.smash\-ingmagazine.com/2011/05/05/innovative-techniques-to-simplify-signups-and-logins/](http://uxdesign.smashingmagazine.com/2011/05/05/innovative-techniques-to-simplify-signups-and-logins/)

\end{aside}

Now we'll implement the first view of our process, where a user can request that a password reset link be sent for a given email address.

\begin{codelisting}
\label{code:}
\codecaption{The reset view}
```python
# ourapp/views.py

from flask import redirect, url_for, render_template

from . import app
from .forms import EmailForm
from .models import User
from .util import send_email, ts

@app.route('/reset', methods=["GET", "POST"])
def reset():
    form = EmailForm()
    if form.validate_on_submit()
        user = User.query.filter_by(email=form.email.data).first_or_404()

        subject = "Password reset requested"

        # Here we use the URLSafeTimedSerializer we created in `util` at the 
        # beginning of the chapter
        token = ts.dumps(self.email, salt='recover-key')

        recover_url = url_for(
            'reset_with_token',
            token=token,
            _external=True)

        html = render_template(
            'email/recover.html',
            recover_url=recover_url)
            
        # Let's assume that send_email was defined in myapp/util.py
        send_email(user.email, subject, html)

        return redirect(url_for('index'))
    return render_template('reset.html', form=form)
```
\end{codelisting}


When the form receives an email address, we grab the user with that email address, generate a reset token and send them a password reset URL. That URL routes them to a view that will validate the token and let them reset the password.

\begin{codelisting}
\label{code:}
\codecaption{A view that handles the reset}
```python
# ourapp/views.py

from flask import redirect, url_for, render_template

from . import app, db
from .forms import PasswordForm
from .models import User
from .util import ts

@app.route('/reset/<token>', methods=["GET", "POST"])
def reset_with_token(token):
    try:
        email = ts.loads(token, salt="recover-key", max_age=86400)
    except:
        abort(404)

    form = PasswordForm()

    if form.validate_on_submit():
        user = User.query.filter_by(email=email).first_or_404()

        user.password = form.password.data

        db.session.add(user)
        db.session.commit()

        return redirect(url_for('signin'))

    return render_template('reset_with_token.html', form=form, token=token)
```
\end{codelisting}

We're using the same token validation method as we did to confirm the user's email address. The view passes the token from the URL back into the template. Then the template uses the token to submit the form to the right URL. Let's have a look at what that template might look like.

\begin{codelisting}
\label{code:}
\codecaption{A template with the reset form}
```jinja
{# ourapp/templates/reset_with_token.html #}

{% extends "layout.html" %}

{% block body %}
<form action="{{ url_for('reset_with_token', token=token) }}" method="POST">
    {{ form.password.label }}: {{ form.password }}<br>
    {{ form.csrf_token }}
    <input type="submit" value="Change my password" />
</form>
{% endblock %}
```
\end{codelisting}

## Summary

- Use the itsdangerous package to create and validate tokens sent to an email address.
- You can use these tokens to validate emails when a user creates an account, changes their email or forgets their password.
- Authenticate users using the Flask-Login extension to avoid dealing with a bunch of session management stuff yourself.
- Always think about how a malicious user could abuse your app to do things that you didn't intend.
